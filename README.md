# QualiVec

**QualiVec** is a Python library for scalable qualitative content analysis powered by Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings. It enables systematic semantic similarity assessment, reference vector construction, and automated classification across diverse textual domains using a hybrid of deductive and inductive coding approaches.

## 🔍 Features

- LLM-based embedding generation (supports OpenAI, HuggingFace models)
- Semantic similarity assessment using cosine similarity
- Deductive and inductive coding support
- Reference vector creation from labeled corpora
- Corpus-driven clustering for robust semantic anchor construction
- Supports large-scale document classification
- Domain-agnostic and model-flexible design (works with GPT, Gemini, MiniLM, etc.)
- Human-level performance in CSR, technical, and sentiment domains
